Can download XML files from the Bundestag API with the help of JSoup in the webcrawler class. It can then read all the XML's from a folder and transform it into my class structure.
From then on we can do multiple things with it, such as serializing my class data into a mongoDB BSON document and saving it in a mongoDB database.
With the Data in the database we can now create a RESTful API and provide data to the frontend website.

Do not use without permission!
